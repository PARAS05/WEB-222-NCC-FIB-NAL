        <h2> A little bit more about me</h2>
        <p1> 
            I am officially know as Paras. I completed my studies up to grade 12 in India and went to NIT for almost a year. 
            Then I came to Canada in last September and still in Canada. I started my first job as a chef and in a very short
            time period, I  was promoted to Head chef as well as the supervisor, due to my cooking and management skills in a
            restraunt named SARA in downtown. After this, a company named Pizzeria Libretto offered me a good pay with less work, so I moved
            there. Though here there is no tips as it is a back kitchen. And I am not a scholar student.

        <h2> My Interest</h2>
        <p2> I am not a good person, but I believe in if you treat me good, I will treat you better. I am also, a very religious person.
            As I an International student, I have made a good grip on time management skills. Also, I have polished my cooking skills.
            Working with different kind if people made me more open minded and provided me interesting information about the geographical location, 
            from where they belongs to.  Being alone everytime made me to believe in my self and thanking myself for whatever I did. I am 
            a workaholic person. I try my best to stay as calm as possible in every situation. I do pray to god everyday.
        </p2>

        <h3> My Future </h3>
        <p3>
          I believe in <b>"hope but never expect"</b>. I am willing to build my carrier as a programmer or website designer. After sometime, I am
           strongly believe to establish a company, which would help people and animals. 
        </p3>
